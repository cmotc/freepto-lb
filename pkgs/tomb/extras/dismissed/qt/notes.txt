Some conventions:
.ui files are designers files
Sometimes it's necessary to create custom widget to extend the functionality
given by designer in a clean way. These files should be called ui_whatever.py

.ui files must be "compiled" using pyuic4. This should be done with make, but
won't be right now. So, for the moment, I'll keep compiled files directly in
the sources, for easiness.
